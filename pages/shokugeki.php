			<p> Yukihira Souma's dream is to become a full-time chef in his father's restaurant and surpass his father's culinary
			 skills. But just as Souma graduates from middle school, his father closes down the restaurant to cook in Europe and 
			 sends Souma to Tootsuki culinary school. The story follows Souma, the chef of a common diner, as he goes through his 
			 high school life trying to become the number one chef at an elite culinary school where only 10% of the students graduate.
			  He makes many friends as well as many enemies on his way to the top. </p>
