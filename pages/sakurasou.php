			<p> In Japan, there is a prestigious school for the arts called Suimei where its many students live in dorms.  
				However, schools are not without their problem children, and Suimei deals with their problem children by 
				sending them to a special dormitory called Sakurasou. The story follows one of the Sakurasou residents named 
				Kanda Sorata who was sent there for keeping cats in his dorm which was against the rules. One day, a new girl 
				named Shiina Mashiro moves into Sakurasou from England. At first, Sorata tries to protect Mashiro, a genius 
				artist, from the strange residents of Sakurasou, but eventually finds out that she has problems of her own as 
				she no idea how to take care of herself. As Sorata is the most responsible of the residents, he is given the 
				task of taking care of her and with this new responsibility, his life changes forever. </p>
