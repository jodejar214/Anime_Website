			<p> On August 10, 2010, the Holy Empire of Britannia began a campaign of conquest of varous countries around the world. 
				One of these countries was Japan. The campaign was easily completed due to Britannia's use of new mobile humanoid 
				armor vehicles called Knightmare Frames. Japan's rights and identity were taken away and is now named Area 11 whose 
				citizens, called Elevens, have difficulties living a normal life while the Britannian aristocracy lives comfortably 
				within their settlements. Although Britannia is much more powerful, many Elevens have joined numerous resistance 
				groups that work towards independence for Japan. This story follows Lelouch, an exiled Imperial Prince of Britannia 
				who had lived in Japan before the invasion and now poses as a student at Ashford Academy in Area 11. Lelouch 
				accidently finds himself in the middle of a battle between a resistance group and Britannian forces. During the 
				battle, he meets a mysterious girl named C.C. who grants him Geass, the power of kings. With his new power, Lelouch 
				adopts the persona of the masked revolutionary, Zero, and begins a war with Britannia alongside his army called the 
				Black Knights to free Area 11 from Britannian rule. </p>
