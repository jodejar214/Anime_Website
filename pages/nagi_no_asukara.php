			<p> A long time ago, all humans lived beneath the sea, but some of them favored the surface and abandoned living 
				underwater permanently. As a result of these actions, they were stripped of their god-given protection called 
				"Ena" which allowed them to live and breathe underwater. Over time, the rift between the people of the sea and 
				of the surface widened and the hatred between the two grew. The story follows Sakishima Hikari and his childhood 
				friends who are forced to leave the sea and attend a school on the surface. There, the group meets Tsumugu Kihara, 
				a fellow student and fisherman who loves the sea as well as other people from the surface. As they make constant 
				contact with the surface people, Hikari and his friends' encounter many problems such as dealing with the 
				discrimination by the surface dwellers, the problems in their bonds and relationships, and an impending danger 
				that threatens the people who live on the surface. </p>
